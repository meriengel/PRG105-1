# TODO 11.1 Introduction to Inheritance
# You are going to create a Dwelling class based on the Automobile
# Sample from the chapter


# create the class Dwelling, the __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors


# add the mutators for all of the data attributes (number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors)


# add the accessors for all of  the data attributes


# Create the class Single_family_home as a sub class of Dwelling
# The __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors, garage_type, yard_size

# call the superclass of Dwelling and pass the required arguments, remember to include self

# initialize the garage_type and yard_size attributes

# create the mutator and accessor methods for the garage_type and yard_size attributes


# demonstrate the Single_family_home class, no need to import because you are in the same file

# create an object from the Single_family_home class with the following information:
# 6 rooms, 1200 square feet, 1 floor, single car garage, .25 acres
# Display the data using the accessor methods


# create the main function

# TODO 11.2 Polymorphism
# Type in the mammal class from program 11-9    lines 1 - 22


# create a Mouse class as a sub class of the mammal class following the Dog example

# create a Bird class as a sub class of the mammal class following the Cat Example


# Follow the example in program 11-10 (no need to import, use main2 instead of main
# because there is already a main on this page) use the Mouse and Bird class that you created
